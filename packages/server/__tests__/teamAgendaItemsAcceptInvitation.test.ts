  // 1. The Team.agendaItems resolver returns null for non-team members
  // 2. This violates the non-nullable constraint in the GraphQL schema
  // 3. The fix is to return [] instead of null

  // 1. Non-members can't access teams at all in the normal query path
  // 2. The issue happens specifically in the AcceptTeamInvitationPayload context
  // 3. The AcceptTeamInvitationPayload.team resolver doesn't check team membership
